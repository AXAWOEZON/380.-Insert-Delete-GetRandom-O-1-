Explanation:

The RandomizedSet class defines a data structure that stores a set of unique integers. It consists of an unordered map (faiter) to store elements as key-value pairs for quick access and an unordered set (elements) to store unique elements for efficient retrieval.
The constructor RandomizedSet() initializes the object. It uses a lambda expression to improve I/O performance by disabling synchronization with C I/O functions and detaching cin and cout.
The insert(int val) function inserts a value into the set if it's not already present and returns true on successful insertion, false otherwise.
The remove(int val) function removes a value from the set if it exists and returns true on successful removal, false otherwise.
The getRandom() function returns a random element from the set.
